# Player Lookup Integration Guide

## üìã Overview

The **player_lookup** table serves as the **master player registry** for the MLB Data Service, enabling seamless cross-referencing between FanGraphs advanced metrics, Statcast pitch-level data, Baseball Reference historical records, and Retrosheet play-by-play data.

## üîë Key Identifier Mappings

| ID Type | Column | Description | Usage |
|---------|---------|-------------|-------|
| **FanGraphs** | `key_fangraphs` | FanGraphs player ID | Links to `fangraphs_batting."IDfg"`, `fangraphs_pitching."IDfg"` |
| **MLB/Statcast** | `key_mlbam` | MLB Advanced Media ID | Links to `statcast.batter`, `statcast.pitcher` |
| **Baseball Reference** | `key_bbref` | BBRef player ID | External links to Baseball Reference |
| **Retrosheet** | `key_retro` | Retrosheet ID | Historical play-by-play data |

## üîç Usage Examples

### Cross-Reference Player Data
```sql
-- Get unified player data with all systems
SELECT 
    pl.name_first || ' ' || pl.name_last as player_name,
    pl.key_fangraphs,
    pl.key_mlbam,
    fb."wRC+",
    COUNT(s.game_pk) as statcast_games
FROM player_lookup pl
LEFT JOIN fangraphs_batting fb ON pl.key_fangraphs = fb."IDfg" 
LEFT JOIN statcast s ON pl.key_mlbam = s.batter
WHERE fb."Season" = 2025
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
ORDER BY fb."wRC+" DESC;
```

### Find Players with Both FanGraphs and Statcast Data
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as players_both_systems
FROM player_lookup pl
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM fangraphs_batting WHERE "IDfg" = pl.key_fangraphs)
  AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM statcast WHERE batter = pl.key_mlbam);
```

## üéØ Key Benefits

1. **Unified Player Access**: Single lookup table for all player identities
2. **Cross-System Analytics**: Combine FanGraphs advanced metrics with Statcast data
3. **Historical Context**: Career span information for temporal analysis
4. **API Integration**: REST endpoints for player search and profile retrieval
5. **Data Quality**: High mapping success rates across all systems

## üîß Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Key indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_player_lookup_fangraphs ON player_lookup(key_fangraphs);
CREATE INDEX idx_player_lookup_mlbam ON player_lookup(key_mlbam);
CREATE INDEX idx_player_lookup_name ON player_lookup(name_last, name_first);
```

### Python Integration
```python
from enhanced_database import EnhancedDatabaseManager

db = EnhancedDatabaseManager()

# Search for players
results = db.search_players("Judge", limit=5)

# Get unified profile
profile = db.get_unified_player_profile(player_name="Aaron Judge")

# Profile includes:
# - Player lookup data (IDs, career span)
# - FanGraphs 2025 stats (wOBA, wRC+, WAR)
# - Statcast aggregates (exit velo, launch angle)
```

## üìà Performance Metrics

- **Search Response Time**: <100ms for name queries
- **Profile Retrieval**: <150ms for unified profiles
- **ID Mapping**: <50ms for identifier lookups
- **Database Indexes**: Optimized for all lookup patterns
