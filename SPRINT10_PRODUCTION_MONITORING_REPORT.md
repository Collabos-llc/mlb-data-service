## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Monitoring Package Structure
```
mlb_data_service/monitoring/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py              # Package exports
â”œâ”€â”€ health_monitor.py        # ProductionHealthMonitor class
â””â”€â”€ alert_manager.py         # AlertManager class
```

### Key Design Patterns

**1. Fault Tolerance**
- Graceful degradation when dependencies unavailable
- Mock data for testing environments
- Optional imports with fallbacks

**2. Production Ready**
- Background monitoring threads
- Connection pooling awareness
- Configurable thresholds and rate limits
- Proper resource cleanup on shutdown

**3. Extensible Architecture**
- Plugin-style notification channels
- Configurable alert suppression rules
- JSON-based configuration support

## ðŸ“Š MONITORING CAPABILITIES

### System Health Monitoring
- **CPU Usage**: Real-time monitoring with warning (70%) and critical (90%) thresholds
- **Memory Usage**: Virtual memory tracking with warning (80%) and critical (95%) thresholds
- **Disk Usage**: Storage monitoring with warning (85%) and critical (95%) thresholds
- **Database Performance**: Connection pool utilization and query response times
- **API Health**: External service availability and response time tracking

### Alert Management
- **Severity Levels**: INFO, WARNING, CRITICAL with appropriate escalation
- **Notification Channels**: 
  - Email (SMTP with HTML formatting)
  - Slack (Rich webhooks with color coding)
  - Custom webhooks (JSON payload)
- **Auto-Recovery**: Intelligent resolution when metrics return to healthy ranges
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents alert storms with configurable intervals

### Dashboard Data
- **Performance Score**: Calculated based on system health metrics
- **Uptime Tracking**: Service availability percentage
- **Real-time Metrics**: Live system and application statistics
- **Alert Summaries**: Active, acknowledged, and resolved alert counts

## ðŸ§ª TESTING & VALIDATION

### Test Suite Created âœ…
**File**: `/test_monitoring_standalone.py`

**Test Results**: âœ… 4/4 tests passed
- Health Monitor Standalone: âœ… PASSED
- Alert Manager Standalone: âœ… PASSED  
- Monitoring Integration: âœ… PASSED
- Configuration & Thresholds: âœ… PASSED

## ðŸ”— INTEGRATION POINTS

### User Journey Agent Dashboard
The monitoring system provides data for real-time dashboard display:
- **Health Status**: Overall service health with color-coded indicators
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time system resource utilization
- **Alert Feed**: Live alert stream with severity indicators
- **Historical Data**: Trend analysis for capacity planning

### Auto-Recovery Mechanisms
- **CPU Recovery**: Auto-resolves when CPU drops below 60%
- **Memory Recovery**: Auto-resolves when memory drops below 70%
- **Response Time Recovery**: Auto-resolves when response time drops below 0.5s
- **API Recovery**: Auto-resolves when external APIs return to healthy status
